# vexCode
This is the coding for our mini model made from VEX parts.
The goal here is to have the mini model do everything that we need the actual robot do. We used PROS for programing the robot; RobotC was avaible, but only on the school computers so we decided to use PROS since it was free. 

We may post the building guide for the mini robot on Insructables or some other similar site. If you would like to see the robot before we get it on said site, email us at 234111@shakopeeschools.org.
